To add Aethereal Planes Battlebacks to your RPG Maker MZ/MV game:

1. Open the Resource Manager from the Tools panel

2. Select img/battlebacks1 from the column on the left

3. Using either the DLC or Import buttons, locate the folder containing Aethereal Planes Battlebacks, and the subfolder for 1000x740 images

4. Select all the images, or just the ones you want, and press Open

5. Repeat steps 2-4 using img/battlebacks2 and the battlebacks2_MV_MZ folder

6. Repeat steps 2-4 using img/titles1 and the 816x624 images




You will notice that the filenames are all prefixed with 'Aethereal_Planes' so you can easily identify them amid the rest of the assets in your folder!

Edit the high-res versions in your choice of graphics software to create alternate views or re-center the art to your liking.
